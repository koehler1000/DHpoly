However, there will be an amount of hints to make it even more accessible for new players.

### 5.3 Reliability

The multiplayer function of the game is hosted on the computer of the game owner. Because of that the reliability depends on the host’s computer and network. Whenever there is a bug, players can use our contact form to send us further information about the error, so we can analyze and solve it as fast as possible.
