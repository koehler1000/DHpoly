## Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given
iteration. 
It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the test effort.

This Test Plan for the DHPoly supports the following objectives:

• Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.

• Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.

• Outlines the testing approach that will be used.

• Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

• Lists the deliverable elements of the test project

### 1.2 Scope

In this document we describe thefollowing levels of testing:
• Unit Testing
• User Interface Testing

### 1.3 Intended Audience

### 1.6 Document Structure

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

The purpose behind testing is to make sure, your project isalways working properly.

### 2.1 Background

If at some point your code contains flaws and you keepprogramming, your code will eventually not run anymore, at some point. 
And once you are there the only way out is to load a recent version from your repository,which is related to investing a lot of time and work.
So that we will hopefully not have that problem, we test ourcode so that we know, whether it is running correctly. 
Additionally that way wewill (hopefully) never publish a not working version of DHPoly.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

We invented testing in our project right away after the start. 
The reason for that is stated above. 
It is necessary to always haveworking code, so that flaws can get recognized in an early stage and be fixed withouta huge amount of investments.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

The motivators for our testing are the following ones:
• Quality risks
• Functional risks
• Technical risks
• Not working use cases
• Not working user interfaces

## 3. Target Test Items

Items for testing: 
• Use cases 
• Server-Client connection and data transmission
